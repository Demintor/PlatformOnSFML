![preview](preview.png)

This is a pilot project - platformer on c++ and sfml. 

To start a project you need:
  1) Clone the repository and download the sfml: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
  2) In the project settings, specify the path to the folder "include", as well as to the .dll files.

The basic idea: the main character wanders around the level solving interesting programming problems. For each correct answer, the salary of the hero increases, for each wrong answer - decreases.

Control:
  movement: keys up, left, right
  answer to the question: keys 1, 2, 3, 4
